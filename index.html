	    <p itemprop="description">
	      Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol commonly used
	      between nearby devices to transfer data, for example between
	      a wireless headset and a phone, or between two phones when
	      transferring files between them. This communication can
	      contain private and sensitive data, and the Bluetooth
	      standard provides security features to protect against
	      eavesdropping and manipulation.  We found an attack that 
	      allows an attacker to break this security
	      mechanism for any standard-compliant Bluetooth device. As a
	      result, an attacker is able to the listen in on, or change
	      the content of, nearby Bluetooth communication, even between
	      devices that have previously been successfully paired.

		  <p>We call our attack the <b>Key Negotiation of
	      Bluetooth</b> (KNOB) Attack. Because this attack affects
	      basically all devices that "speak Bluetooth", we decided
	      to coordinate public disclosure with industry to try to
	      make sure that workarounds could be put in place. In
	      November 2018 we shared details of the attack with the
	      Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth
	      SIG)&mdash;the standards organisation that oversees the
	      development of Bluetooth standards&mdash;as well as the
	      CERT Coordination Center and the International
	      Consortium for Advancement of Cybersecurity on the
	      Internet (ICASI)&mdash;an industry led coordination body
	      founded by Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Juniper and
	      IBM.</p>

		<p>For more information on affected systems
		see <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918987/">the
		CVE</a>. The technical details of the attack is
		available in
		our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/antonioli">research
		    paper</a>. TL;DR: The entropy of Bluetooth
		session keys is negotiated in an unauthenticated
		protocol between the participants. The attacker can
		manipulate this to the lowest entropy allowed, 1 byte. The resulting session key can then
		easily be brute forced.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Are my Devices Vulnerable?</h2>
	    <p itemprop="description">
	      The KNOB attack is possible due to flaws in the
	      Bluetooth specification. As such, any standard-compliant
	      Bluetooth device can be expected to be vulnerable. We
	      conducted KNOB attacks on more than 17 unique Bluetooth
	      chips (by attacking 24 different devices). At the time
	      of writing, we were able to test chips from Broadcom,
	      Qualcomm, Apple, Intel, and Chicony manufacturers. <b>All
	      devices that we tested were vulnerable to the KNOB
	      attack</b>.</p>

	      <p>After we disclosed our attack to industry in late 2018,
	      some vendors might have implemented workarounds for the
	      vulnerability on their devices. So the short answer is: if
	      your device was not updated after late 2018, it is likely
	      vulnerable. Devices updated afterwards might be fixed.
